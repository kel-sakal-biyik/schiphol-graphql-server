# schiphol-graphql-api
Welcome to the workshop. Our goal is to create an express application
which serves a GraphQL endpoint for Schiphol API using graphql-js and
Apollo.

First of all, we need our initial dependencies in place. Our `package.json`
file is ready for installation. Let's have a look what it will install for us:

- **graphql:** Javascript implementation for GraphQL
- **express:** Express server. We will create our application to serve GraphQL
- **apollo-server-express:** Express integration of GraphQL server
- **graphql-tools:** Helper library for schema creation
- **body-parser:** Will use for parsing our responses to JSON
- **nodemon:** Will run our application and watch our files for changes

So, go ahead and run `npm install` or `npm i`

After the installation ends go to _step 1_ by checking out the branch:

`git checkout step-1`
